# IMPORTANT: Make sure your AzureVision:Endpoint and Key are NOT committed
# These should be managed as Azure App Service Application Settings, not in source control.
# If you currently have them in appsettings.json, you MUST remove them from there
# BEFORE committing and store them only in environment variables or Azure App Settings.
# For a side project, if you're not planning complex secret management,
# you can remove them from appsettings.json and set them directly in Azure's
# application settings for the App Service.
